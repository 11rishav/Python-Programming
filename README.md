#🌟 A Python Journey — From "Hello World" to Little Wonders 🐍
#“It all started with a simple line: print("Hello Python")... and from there, things got beautifully out of hand.”

#📖 My Coding Diary 
##I didn’t set out to build anything grand.
##All I wanted was to understand Python — one tiny program at a time.

##So I opened PyCharm. Typed some lines. Broke stuff. Fixed it. Googled errors.
##Reran. Laughed. Cried. Celebrated.
##And somehow, this became a collection of over a hundred little programs — each teaching me a new piece of the puzzle.

#🧠 What’s Inside?
##This repo is split across two files: First.py and second.py. Together, they’re like the chapters of my Python story.

#📘 First.py — The First Steps
###This file is all about the building blocks of Python.

##Printing, swapping, converting values.

##Finding primes, leap years, Armstrong numbers.

##Writing Fibonacci sequences — both iterative and recursive.

##Playing with arrays, lists, strings, and simple logic.

##Even calculating BMI and solving quadratic equations!

##This was me learning how to think like a programmer.
##And every snippet here was a mini adventure.

#📙 second.py — The Confidence Booster
##This is where things started getting spicy 🌶️.

##Sorting dictionaries ✅

##Writing custom classes and generators ⚙️

##Validating passwords, compressing strings, binary search 🧠

##List comprehensions, lambda functions, and funky challenges 😎

##String manipulation, Hamming distances, ASCII tricks 🔤

##Real-world problems like interest calculation, cone volume, and secret societies 🤝

##This file became my playground for logic, creativity, and experimenting without fear.

#🧩 Why You Might Love This Repo
##You're just starting out with Python and want hands-on examples.

##You like small, self-contained programs that teach real logic.

##You’re preparing for interviews or coding challenges.

##You want to rediscover the joy of building things from scratch.

#❤️ Final Words
##This isn’t a framework.
##This isn’t a tutorial.
##It’s a learning journey — in raw .py files — that shows how much you can grow if you just start somewhere.
